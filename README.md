# What the fork?
Yep, this project is a fork of the fantastic open hardware designed by Keith Burzinkski. Check out [the awesome design that this fork is based on](https://github.com/kbx81/kbxIRBlaster)! In many ways, this project is inferior to what he made, but intentionally inferior!

# Why the fork?
I used to buy Tuya IR blasters, pop them open and re-flash the firmware with ESPhome Like many IoT folks used to do. Then they stopped including wifi modules compatible with ESPhome. Well, left with no alternative, I guess I'll have to make them myself! A quick search found Keith's project which met most of my goals, but he designed it for high quality, maximum flexibility, and convenience of the user. My goal is primarily low cost, similarity to the old Tuya products, and bonus points if it can be assembled by JLC PCB.

# kbx and fsckyou IR Blaster

## What?

Just another ESP8266-based IR Blaster. It was designed with
 [ESPHome](https://esphome.io) in mind but should work fine with
 [Tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/) or any other app, really.

This design is round and should be pretty omnidirectional similar to the Tuya products you can buy on Amazon or Aliexpress.

I'll post images once I have them produced. As of now, this is only a design in progress.

## How?

I'll fill this part in later once the design is more final. ;)
